In this Virtual Internship

In the First Task I was given three datasets, demographic data, location data and transaction data. After cleaning the data I merged all three datasets for further analysis.

The task was to analyse high valued customer so that it will be easier to find out potential customers from new transaction data. I used to models, Cluster Analysis and RFM Analysis. 

Then I made two dashboards Product Analysis, which monitored the performance of different products and Demographic Analysis which answers where our customers are coming from?
